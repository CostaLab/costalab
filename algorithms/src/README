README for .cse scripts.

To find out the available parameters and options for each script, run 
    `*.py -h`.

* reference.py
    - contains the original implementation (+ corrections) of Manuel which can 
    be accessed via the '-f' option. By default (without -f), the script runs
    all corrections AND speed optimizations (pvalue calculation, count function),

* cse_indel.py
    - this script contains all corrections and optimizations but no fallback
    mode. Additionally, it calculate insertions and deletions along SNPS.
