ALIGNMENTS:

	- re-run 454 experiments with bwa-mem, as it was much superior to bwa backtrack (optionally, run also bwa-sw)
		- S. enterica serovar_enteritidis_str_EC20090193
		- E. Coli K-12 substr. MG1655
	- re-run PacBio with its own aligner, blasr (and compare)
	- re-run some experiments with novoalign (and compare)

--------------------------------------------------

MOTIF ANALYSIS:
	- which motifs are "unique" to a specific platform?
	- which are mostly common (across platforms)?
	- among the "common" ones, is ERD consistent?

--------------------------------------------------

VARIANT CALLING:
	- analyse gatk results to see if snps contain motifs
