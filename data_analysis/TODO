ALIGNMENTS:

	- re-run 454 experiments with bwa-mem, as it was much superior to bwa backtrack (optionally, run also bwa-sw)
		- S. enterica serovar_enteritidis_str_EC20090193
		- E. Coli K-12 substr. MG1655
	- re-run PacBio with its own aligner, blasr (and compare)
	- re-run some experiments with novoalign (and compare)

--------------------------------------------------

MOTIF ANALYSIS:
	- which motifs are "unique" to a specific platform, and which are common?
		- select highest ERDs, to only show a few motifs
	- are motifs consistent between runs/experiments (same platform)?
		- extract common ones and produce a measure of "similarity"
	- are motifs consistent between organisms (same platform)?
		- extract common ones and produce a measure of "similarity"
	- among the "common" ones, is ERD consistent?

Define "common":
	- strict: exact match
	- loose:  match with wildcards (Ns)

	For every set to compare (ie, a group of Runs/Experiments or multiple organisms while fixing platform):
		- compute common motifs (recalculating tables etc)
		- calculate overlap coefficient: size(A & B) / min(size(A), size(B))
			- it tells us how much certain sets are overlapped: if a set is included in another, the overlap is 1
		- calculate Jaccard similarity: size(A & B) / size(A | B)

--------------------------------------------------

VARIANT CALLING:
	- analyse gatk results to see if snps contain motifs
